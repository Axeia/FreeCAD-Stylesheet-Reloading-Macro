# StylesheetRefresh
Whilst playing around with .qss files to see what can be done with stylesheets in FreeCAD I kept doing this:
```mermaid
flowchart  LR
A1[Edit]-->B1[Preferences]-->C1[Select different\n stylesheet]-->D1[Apply]-->E1[Reselect previous\n stylesheet]-->F1[Apply]-->G1[Close preferences\n window]
```
Which gets old really fast so I figured there should be a better way, I couldn't find one but I could and did write one, which is what this macro is.
Instead of all those clicks, install the macro and just hit the button below and it should instantly reload the currently used stylesheet.
